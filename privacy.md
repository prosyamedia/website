## Commitment to Privacy
At **prosya.com**, we prioritize your privacy. This policy explains our commitment to maintaining a website that does not track, collect, or store your personal information.

### No Data Collection
We do not collect any personal data from our visitors. This includes, but is not limited to: 
*   **Identity:** Names or contact information.
*   **Technical Data:** IP addresses or device identifiers.
*   **Location:** Geographic location data.

### No Tracking or Cookies
Our website is built to be a **“zero-cookie”** environment. We do not use:
*   **Cookies:** We do not place small files on your device to track your behavior.
*   **Tracking Pixels:** We do not use invisible images to monitor your activity.
*   **Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics) that store user data.

### Third-Party Services
While we do not collect your data, our website may use essential third-party infrastructure (such as hosting providers or CDNs) to deliver content to your browser. These services may temporarily process your IP address to facilitate the connection, but **prosya.com** does not have access to, nor do we store, this information. 

### External Links
Our website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any website you visit.

### Your Rights
Because we do not collect or store any of your personal data, we do not have any information to provide, modify, or delete upon request. Your privacy is protected by default through our non-collection policy.

### Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy occasionally to reflect changes in our website’s technical structure. Any updates will be posted on this page with a new “Effective Date.”
