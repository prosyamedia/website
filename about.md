About Anmol Mishra

Filmmaker at Prosya

Welcome to Prosya. I am Anmol Mishra, a filmmaker and producer dedicated to the art of cinematic storytelling. My work focuses on high-aesthetic production and emotional resonance, bridging the gap between human movement and narrative depth.

Cinematic Journey & Credits

        My passion for capturing the human experience has led to a diverse body of work across global and independent platforms.

                Life In A Day (2011): I am honored to have been a contributor to this historic global documentary project produced by Ridley Scott and directed by Kevin Macdonald. This experience solidified my belief in the power of collective storytelling and the beauty of the "everyday" captured through the lens.

                Death (2024): In this 2024 production, I explored the profound and often silent themes of transition and legacy, further refining my signature atmospheric and contemplative directing style.

                Romancing Sydney (2025): My recent work continues to push the boundaries of the dance-film genre, exploring the symbiosis of movement, rhythm, and urban landscape.

The Vision

        As the driving force behind Prosya, I view cinema as a universal language. Whether producing an intimate character study or directing large-scale visual projects, my goal is to create immersive experiences that linger with the audience long after the credits roll.

Production Excellence

        In my role as a Producer, I oversee projects from the spark of an initial idea to final distribution. In 2026, my focus remains on maintaining the highest standards of production quality while embracing innovative distribution models. I believe in a collaborative approach, working with diverse talents to bring complex, beautiful, and thought-provoking stories to life.
